# Dart Data Structure Challenges

This repository contains implementations of key data structure challenges in Dart, using a singly linked list and stack.  
It covers:

- Printing a linked list in reverse using a stack.
- Finding the middle node of a linked list.
- Reversing a linked list in-place.
- Removing all occurrences of a specific value from a linked list.
- Reversing a list using stack.
- Checking for balanced parentheses using stack.

These challenges demonstrate core data structure manipulations in Dart, especially how to manage nodes and stack logic manually.
